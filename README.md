# Password Generator

A small Rust CLI tool that generates strong random passwords using:
- Lowercase & uppercase English letters  
- Digits and symbols  
- Unicode characters (Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic)

I built this as my first Rust project to learn how to work with
secure randomness and Unicode characters.
## Password strength example (From Password Monster)

## Features
- 30-character passwords  
- Cryptographically secure randomness (OsRng)  
- Guarantees at least one character from each category  
- Generates multiple passwords per run  

## How to run
Make sure you have Rust installed.

		```bash
		cargo run


## Notes 

Some websites may not accept Unicode characters in passwords..

This generator is best used with a password manager.
